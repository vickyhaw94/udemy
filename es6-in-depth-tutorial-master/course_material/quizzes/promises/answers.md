Optional Quiz: Examining Promises and Asynchronous Programming

Here comes an optional quiz. Let's go over important concepts that came up in our exploration of asynchronous programming and ES6 promises.

1)

Which type of programming refers to programs that run on continuous loop to divert blocking operations to different handlers?

a) synchronous programming

Explanation: Nope. Synchronous programming refers to a programs that run in sequence, from top to bottom, that may encounter blocking operations.

**b) asynchronous programming** // answer

Explanation: Correct! Asynchronous programming runs on a loop and defers blocking operations to handlers in order to maintain a running state.



2)

What are the three states that an es6 promise can have?

**a) Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected** //answer

Explanation: Correct! Pending, Fulfilled, and Rejected represent the three states in fulfilling a promise.

b) Almost, Done, Half-Completed

Explanation: Incorrect. Hint: One of the conventional keywords for consuming a promise in its .then() method is 'reject'.

c) Paused, Yield, Continue

Explanation: Incorrect: Hint: One of the conventional keywords for consuming a promise in its .then() method is 'reject'.
