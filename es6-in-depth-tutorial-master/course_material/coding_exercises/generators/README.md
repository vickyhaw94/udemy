##Coding Exercise: Generation XYZ

Let's generate the last three letters of the alphabet! Fix this generator function so that we see 'x', 'y', 'z', and undefined when calling letterGen.next().value four times.


**Directions**
Add three yield statements to the letterMaker generator that yield 'x', 'y', and 'z' respectively. Don't add a fourth yield because the letterMaker should return undefined after a third call. Also, you do not need to delete the letterGen instance of the letterMaker.
