##Coding Exercise: Fender Bender (Classes)

Jacob runs a music shop and has classes that represent each of his instruments. To make his life a little easier, he added a describe method to each class that tells him the name of the instrument and its family type. However, something's wrong with that method, so he needs your help to fix it!

**Directions**
The 'fender' variable is an instance of the Guitar class with "Fender" and "strings" properties. However, the describe method in the Guitar class is broken. Fix the describe method so that it **returns**:
"I'm a Fender from the strings family."

Use this.name and this.type in order to log the message!
