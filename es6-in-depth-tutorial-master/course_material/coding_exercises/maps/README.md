##Coding Exercise: How Many Times Does this Letter Appear? (Maps)

Let's count some letters in Mary Poppins's favorite word:
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

**Directions:**
Address the three todos to fix the countLetter function. First, create the 'letters' map. Secondly, add a letter to the map if it doesn't exist in the map yet. Finally, update any encountered letters if they already exist in the map.

Note: Don't delete the last two lines, as the exercise will test if your method returns the correct count for 'a', and the correct count for 'x'.
